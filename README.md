# List of Features:
When I first started creating this game I was plannning to use a container for each question. I created all of my divs with all of my information in HTML, but then realized that is not how I wanted to do things. I had already spent almost two days on this code and was gutted to see it go! Honestly, I even cried a bit. After getting loads of help from David, Skyler and Jeremiah I was starting to feel a bit more comoftable with my code come Wednesday afternoon. I had moved all of my questions into objects in a transformers array in javascript. Created radio buttons in my HTML and had it styled just right. Thursday morning was when I decided I would show the player their score as they played and even propmt them with an alert if they were incorrect. After I felt comfortable with my scoring I created a reset button and an alert to end the game.
